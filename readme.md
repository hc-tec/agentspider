# AgentSpider
AgentSpider is an automated spider tool, and with the help of LLM, we can make spider simpler

# How to use
1. Install the dependencies 
    
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Change the configs/model_configs.json to set your llm api key
    
    ```"api_key": "change-to-your-api-key",```
3. To test the spider, run the following command:
    
    ```python test/taskflow_test.py```
4. More, we are developing the automated spider tool, and waiting for it. We need some time to finish it.
